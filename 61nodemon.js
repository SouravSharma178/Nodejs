// Nodemon is a very time saving package as it runs our code continously so we do not need to run our code everytime we make a change
// to install nodemon we will type sudo npm i install -g
// the - g is used to install nodemon globally on our system
// once we save our file it will automatically update the code
console.warn("Try nodemon178");
